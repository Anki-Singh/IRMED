                    The Institute for Resource management and Economic Development (IRMED) has emerged
                    as a leading center for knowledge generation and dissemination on resource management issues in
                    India as well as South Asia. IRMED is an innovative institute conducting research and education. The
                    Institute imparts education for computer applications to students for CIT and BCA degrees of Indira
                    Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU). It conducts research in the relatively neglected fields of
                    socio-economic and institutional aspects of development and management of water, land, forests and
                    related resources on the one hand and studies concerning woman on the other. IRMED treats such
                    issues as extremely vital for the welfare of India's people as well as for raising the country's
                    competitive position and social image in the global system.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    IRMED's major strengths lie in the flexibility, speed, and efficiency of execution of its projects,
                    its established credibility and its objectivity in analysis and recommendations. It has a credible
                    record of conducting a large number of high quality policy oriented studies, important seminars,
                    conferences and policy dialogues and highly useful training programmes for senior government
                    officers. Having considerable interaction with government departments, leading NGOs and
                    international agencies and having established its reputation as an independent think tank, IRMED is
                    in an ideal position to aid and influence policy formulation, a task which it has been performing
                    with competence. Given its track record, IRMED is destined to forge ahead in serving the nation with
                    still greater vigor and enthusiasm.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    IRMED aspires for a society where basic resources like land, water, forests, energy, manpower etc.
                    are utilized in the most efficient and equitable manner specially serving the interest of the poor
                    while at the same time, promoting environmental sustainability. It is my earnest hope that the IRMED
                    scales up its level of activities and continues to serve the nation for decades to come. I also hope
                    that it continues to pursue its mission with renewed vigor to realize the noble vision that it has
                    set before itself.
