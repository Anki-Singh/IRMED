                    The Institute has played an active part in organizing seminars and conferences on important policy
                    related issues. These have been organized in Delhi as well as in other parts of the country and have
                    generally been sponsored by different ministries of Government of India, State Governments,
                    international and other agencies. All the seminars and conferences have been well attended with the
                    right mix of participation from government, academic institutions and NGOs depending upon the
                    context. These seminars and conferences have come forward with very useful recommendations. The list
                    of such seminars/conferences including the very famous International Conference on Sustainable
