                    Conducting research has been an important activity of the Institute ever since 1983 when it was
                    established. Almost all the research projects undertaken have been sponsored either by different
                    ministries of Government of India or by international agencies. Most of the research and evaluation
                    projects have dealt with policy oriented issues related to management and development of water
                    resources, rural development and poverty eradication, environmental preservation, gender studies and
                    socio-economic development. A majority of the studies have involved conduct of large scale
                    socio-economic field surveys resulting in collection of primary data. Such surveys have been
                    conducted in almost all the parts of India. A list of research/evaluation projects conducted till
                    2016is given below.
